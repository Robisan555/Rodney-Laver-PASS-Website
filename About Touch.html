        <h3 class="rules-title">Life and Journey</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>Rodney George Laver was born on the 9th of August, 1938. Laver was the son of two tournament lawn tennis players, so he was introduced early to the game. He was considered too small to become a good player, so he began to practice much
            more vigorously as a youth in the Australian outback. Later, he got noticed by Australian Davis Cup captain, Harry Hopman, and because of this, he became a member of the Australian Davis Cup squad at the age of 18. His first outstanding
            success was winning the Australian doubles championship with Robert Mark and the Wimbledon mixed doubles championship with Robert Mark in 1959. They won the Australian singles in 1960. He won a bunch more championships later on and led
            Australia to victory every single time he competed. </p>
        </ul>

      <div class="rules col-lg-4 col-md-12">
        <h3 class="rules-title">Significant Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>He became professional in 1963 and dominated the professional game with his power and accuracy. Open tournaments were created in 1968 and thus he was able to win the first-ever open Wimbledon championship. He continued to play into the
            1970s and in 1971 he was the first professional player to surpass the $1 000 000 mark in career prize money, and he held this title as the tennis’s all-time leading money winner until 1978. Rod Laver was inducted into the International
            Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981. In 2000, the court in the centre of Melbourne Park was renamed the ‘Rod Laver Arena’, and remains to be that until the present day. </p>

        <h3 class="rules-title">Legacy</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>After American Don Budge in 1938, Rod Laver became the second man to complete all the Grand Slams in 1962. Laver became the first player to win all the Grand Slam titles twice in 1969. Laver returned to the Grand Slam stage after a
            five-year exile as an outlaw pro, winning the first Open Wimbledon in 1968 and the first Australian Open in 1969. Rod Laver also became the first tennis player to earn a million dollars in prize money. </p>

      <h2>Challenges and Societal Norms</h2>
      <ul class="origin-ul">
        <p>Rod Laver was very short. He wasn’t able to beat his opponents by overpowering them, he had to use his speed and agility to overcome their shots. Laver grew up in the outback, meaning that he had little resources and opportunity to play
          tennis. He set up his own rolled court on the family’s cattle farm, and was able to keep practising. He was extremely lucky to have been noticed by Australia’s legendary Davis Cup captain Harry Hopman, who was able to enrol him into the
          Australian Davis Cup team, and just three years later, he won his first grand slam title. He continued to rack up more titles and by doing so, he acts as a continuous spring of inspiration for new generations. </p>
